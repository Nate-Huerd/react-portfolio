      <p>
      I work as a Business Analyst for ShippersEdge TMS (Transportation Management System). I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. Completing this program will allow me to transition from the Business Analyst role into the role of a full stack developer. As I complete more projects during this bootcamp, I will update this portfolio to include links directly to those projects.
