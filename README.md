# Nate Huerd's Coding Portfolio

This repository is currently an in-progress build of my coding portfolio. As more content is finished, this repository will be updated.

This app was built using React so that it works as a single page application. Similar to the version without React, there is an About Me section, a Homepage showing my projects, and a Contact Me section. I have added a Resume navigation tab that loads up a copy of my resume for quick reference.

There are more projects in the works. To get an update on what I am currently working on, please email me at nhuerd3@gmail.com.
